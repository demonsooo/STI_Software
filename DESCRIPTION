Description: This is a package implementing log-likelihood based expectation-
    maximization(EM) algorithm to predict STI probability based on imperfect
    diagnostic tests. It allows users to input binary, categorical, and continuous
    covariates changing or fixed over time. Groups with different sensitivity/
    specificity due to technology used could be detected and separated.
